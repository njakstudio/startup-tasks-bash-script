# Startup Script

A basic shell script to do all startup maintenance on a linux machine
in one terminal command.

## Usage 
Just download the script into a directory on your computer and run the 
following command:

~$ sudo ./startup.sh

The script will run through updating and upgrading a linux system and 
outputing a log of what the script did.
